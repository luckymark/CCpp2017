		you could use up, down, left, right to move the character witch is presented by the symbol '@'.
		the symbol '#' shows the wall and the character cannot go through it.
		when you meet some special symbol, such as '%', '*', they are actually the portal and you could press the botton 'x' to go through the portal.
#inportant# when you see the symbol '^', that is the gate for you to leave, which means you could win the game.
