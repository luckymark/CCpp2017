##push the box##

#install#
		1.you could use the command 'make' to install the game on your computer.
		2.***this game could only run on the Unix/Linux system.***
		3.you may need to install Xcode on your mac.

#play_method#

		2.here are some symbols and their means:
			@: the character
			B: the box
			x: the target
		3.you could use 'q' to quit the game, but you may lost the data of the current game you play.
		4.you could use 'a' to play the previous task, and use 'd' to play the next task.
		5.you could use 'r' to restart the current task.
		6.the game has a score system and the data was saved in the file named 'score'. if no one have played a task before, the high score will show -1.
#the_map#
		1.you may want to edit your own map. you could finish this by creating a file named 'map'+'digit'. And then you should change the 'task_num' in my.c and run the 'make' again.I do want to put 'task_num' in a seperated file, but acctually, it is uesless. then you should create a file called 'mid'+'digit',which is used to suggest the number of the task. you could see 'get_num.sh' if you have some question about this file.
that's it. have fun...
